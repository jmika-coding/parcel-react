# Parcel React

This project aims at using parcel with React and Typescript.<br>
It is to learn more about [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/), without using the classic [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) starter, and instead use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), which also seems better.

It need `index.html` as a starter page, that will load the script `index.tsx`.<br>
And this last file is used to get the _domNode_ from the html page, and used it to create root for the React application, to render its components.<br>
The main React component that will load all other React component is `MainApp.tsx`.
